NOTICE:

This project is not associated with Xavier Leroy's paper titled "Yet Another Programming Language" (YAPL),  
which was published in 1991. While the name of this project is similar to the title of that paper,  
it is a distinct and separate effort that is not affiliated with Xavier Leroy or his work.  

The YAPL programming language described in Xavier Leroy's paper is a functional  
programming language that was developed for teaching and research in functional programming.  
The YAPL project on GitHub, on the other hand, is a general purpose programming language  
that combines features from many different languages including features such as pattern matching, type inference, and garbage collection.

While both projects share some similarities, they are distinct and separate efforts that address different goals and use cases.  

We hope that this clarification helps to avoid any confusion or misunderstandings.  
If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us.
